## Support Metrics Overview

This document demonstrates an understanding of common customer support metrics
used to measure performance and service quality in remote support environments.

### Metrics Included

**First Response Time**
Measures how quickly a support agent responds to a new ticket.
Fast response times help reassure users that their issue is being addressed.

**Resolution Time**
Tracks how long it takes to fully resolve an issue.
Lower resolution times indicate efficient troubleshooting and clear communication.

**Ticket Volume by Category**
Shows the most common types of issues received (e.g., login, access, software issues).
This helps identify patterns and areas where documentation or automation could help.

**SLA Awareness**
Support teams often operate under Service Level Agreements (SLAs).
Meeting SLA targets helps maintain customer satisfaction and trust.

### Example Insights
- Login-related issues are common and benefit from documented playbooks
- Clear communication reduces resolution time
- Consistent processes help maintain SLA compliance
