## Remote Support Workflow

### 1. Ticket Intake
Support requests may arrive via email, chat, or support portal.

### 2. Triage & Prioritization
- Identify issue category (login, VPN, application, etc.)
- Assess urgency and impact
- Assign priority level

### 3. Troubleshooting
- Gather required details from the user
- Follow documented playbooks when available
- Document all steps taken in the ticket

### 4. Escalation
Escalate issues when:
- Multiple users are impacted
- Security or access risks are identified
- The issue persists after standard troubleshooting
- A system-wide outage is suspected

### 5. Resolution & Closure
- Confirm resolution with the user
- Provide clear next steps or prevention tips
- Close the ticket and update documentation if needed
